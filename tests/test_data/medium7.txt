The notion that this movie belongs in the top 100 of anybody's list is simply retarded. This B-movie with an A-movie list is standard, run of the mill, TV-movie-of-the-week fare. How did it get this high? What's wrong with the vast number of IMDB users that they would vote so highly in favor of such a piece of trite? My theory: Tim Robbins is sending each of you a check. That's the only explanation. This movie offers nothing special: nothing different, nothing unique. No great performances (a phoned-in Morgan Freeman performance akin to his Deep Impact presidential performance), no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind bars--nothing. This movie achieves what few in history have done: it both sucks AND blows.
