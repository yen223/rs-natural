The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison. He remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named Red ( Morgan Freeman). I really don't see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time, the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing, it is pretty poorly directed, the plot is thinner than air,there are no risks taken,and there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie, in fact you wouldn't even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end. The title already gives away the whole big finale of the movie. I don't see how anyone could possibly compare THIS to actually great movies like EVERYTHING that is below is on the Top 25. And the simple thought of this winning Best Picture back in '94, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!, it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life, I still can't possibly see how the Academy could have even nominated this as the Best Picture of 1994. Anyway the only thing that saves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving this a poor grade.
